# Growth Tracker 🌱

**Track every hour of your day. Build better habits. Grow intentionally.**

Growth Tracker is a personal productivity app that helps you account for all 24 hours of your day. By tracking how you spend your time across different life activities, you gain insights into your daily patterns and build consistency through streaks.

## What is Growth Tracker?

We all have the same 24 hours, but few of us know where they actually go. Growth Tracker solves this by letting you log your time across meaningful categories — sleep, study, work, family, fitness, and more.

The goal is simple: **complete your day by logging all 24 hours**. Do it consistently, and watch your streak grow!
